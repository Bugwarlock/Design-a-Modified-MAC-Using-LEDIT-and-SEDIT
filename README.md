# Design a Modified MAC Using LEDIT and SEDIT and Calculate it's Fault Possibility and Test it with SCOPE Analysis on a Xilinx
In this project, we designed a full-adder with LEDIT then import it in SEDIT which results in developing a 4-bit full-adder layout. After that, we analyzed the circuit SCOPE parameters in order to calculate it's fault possibility then generate a test set and applied the test set via a test-bench and tested the circuit.
This project was a joint project for AVLSI and Test and Testability courses.
